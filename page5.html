An idea I've had for a project has been sitting with me for quite a while to create a mobile app that keeps track
 of Classic Car registrations and information that can be shared with other users. The premise of the app is to input 
 information about the Vehicle with information like; VIN, Colour, Date of last service and a list of mods done to
 the car. Amongst all this information the main objective of the app is to keep track of where the car has been driven
 as well as on what days to make filling in the classic car log book easier and more streamlined.

The motivation for this project is because being a car enthusiast and having many friends who are as well we realised
 that there isn't a ‘certrial hub’ or database for users to share car details with each other whilst also keeping track
 of our club car days in Australia. With these thoughts we realised that there is a fairly large gap in the car enthusiast 
 targeted market that could be filled. With the mainstream use of smartphones and the greater ability for beginners to get
 into app developing we realised that this was a feasible idea with a large potential user base.

	  The main point of this app was to have a very user-friendly experience that was similar to social media in a way whilst
	  also allowing users to keep their information private. The user will have the choice to sign up with facebook, gmail or
	  just a normal email but they will be required to make a unique username. Once an account has been created you have the
	  option to add your own vehicles and their details like; VIN, registration, colour and photos. Once all these details are
	  entered the user can also enter details on their car like when their registration is due and every time they drive the 
	  car so cars registered under the historic car scheme can keep track of how many days they've driven since they are legally
	  only allowed to drive 45 or 90 days a year. Journeys can also be recorded using GPS services showing the average speed of
	  the vehicle as well as the locations it's been. The user will also be able to write a description of the vehicle which can
	  include mods and repairs as well as any other information they would like to include. Photos and short videos with a maximum 
	  length of 1 minute will be able to be posted as well. All information a user posts can be public, semi-public (only certain 
	  information and certain cars will be able to be viewed by the public), for friends only and private. Users will also be able
	  to search for other users using user names or search for vehicles with VINs or number plates. The information will be able 
	  to be searched for but the owner of the car's privacy settings will ultimately be what limits the amount of information
	  available to view for the car. Users will also be able to add friends like they would on any other social media platforms
	  which lets you follow people's car builds and keep up to date with any changes with their vehicles. Later on it the apps 
	  development a marketplace similar to facebook's one may be implemented allowing users to sell car parts and cars to others
	  and since the cars and parts will (hopefully) have a documented history on the app meaning that the information could help 
	  a user deem if the product is worth purchasing and if its been looked after.  Finally a small forum may be added in where 
	  you can ask questions about your specific make and model of car to get other users to help with any trouble shooting.
	  In essence this app will be almost like facebook but exclusively for cars whilst also having a practical use for users
	  to keep track of information on their own car to also make their life easier when dealing with servicing and historic 
	  registration.

	 When developing this app multiple different programs will be used as well as different systems. When developing an app 
	 the hardware won't really be a restriction since most standard systems will be able to program it.
	 Programs that will be used will most likely be Xamarin since it is an open source software that is used to produce apps
	 for IOS, android and windows allowing the app to be used on different devices. Amongst that the database and storage of
	 all the user information will have to be stored on a server which will most likely be a cloud storage service rented from 
	 a larger corporation when the app is fully running but when the app is still being developed the server will probably be 
	 hosted on a private server so buying an enterprise level computer and using ASP.NET core since its a cross platform data
	 management software and will be easy to access with Xamarin.

The skills required to setup this app would definitely be programming skills in C# since that's what language Xamarin 
and ASP.NET use. Amongst C# skills in database management and programming are basic. Hardware for the server will be 
fairly easy to come by and may have a wait time for parts to come from overseas. The skills necessary will be fairly 
easy to learn or find people with the existing knowledge since C# is such a popular programming language. Skills like
 UI designer and how to utilize user testing will be important too.

	  If this app development is successful then there will be a widespread social media and utility app for car enthusiasts.
	  The app can be used by an individual to keep track of their own car and club registration usage and history. Whilst also
	  being an app to research people and the cars they own when possible purchasing cars. The app will also act like a forum 
	  for like minded car enthusiasts to come together and bond over their passion.
