   	  	I always believe that these kinds of personality tests should be taken with a grain
		of salt since they can't be accurate at depicting what you act like and your strengths
		and weaknesses but if they are to believe all three tests i've taken could have valuable
		personal learning and personality attributes. Being an ASTP-A according to my 16 personality
		quiz it means that I'm rational, spontaneous and relaxed whilst also being optimistic.
		According to my 5 personality test which tells you what your personality most reflects 
		tells me that I am an emotionally stable person first of all. Finally the learning style
		test showed that my preferred learning style is Tactile or kinesthetic.

   	  	These results could influence me to work certain ways within a team. For example, according to
		my personality quiz I'm an ASTP-A meaning that when working within a team I would be very 
		suited for prioritising tasks as that is apparently a strength that my personality type has. 
		But also according to that personality type I will also be stubborn so when working with a team
		I'd have to focus on being open minded. When working in high stress situations in a team environment
		I will be able to keep a cool and level headed thought train according to my personality type as well
		as Big 5 personality type. So in moments of high pressure I should be helping the team focus and 
		prevent unwanted and unneeded distractions.

   	  Taking these personal qualities into consideration when forming a team will be imperative for smooth operations
	  and collaborative working. When looking for team members I would need to find individuals who are engaged and 
	  interested as well as energetic because according to my 16 personality I am energetic meaning that my team would
	  hopefully match that trait. Although a weakness that I would have would be that I'm insensitive and tend to take 
	  risks so I'd need teammates who would not hesitate to keep me in check when doing something reckless.
