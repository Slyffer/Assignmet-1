   My intent in studying IT stemmed from when I was 12 years old. When I first moved into high school my
   peers used to play PC games like league of legends and Counterstrike. Since I previously only played 
   video games on consoles I didn't have a powerful enough computer to run the games I wanted to play 
   with my friends so I started looking into building computers and what hardware I needed. I ended up 
   getting addicted to watching Linus Tech Tips (LTT) and from there became really interested in computer
   hardware and gaming. My IT experience is fairly limited outside of assembling computer systems and doing
   a small amount of programming during year 12.

The reason I chose to study at RMIT was mainly because of my previous course. I was originally set on studying
 construction management after talking to a mutual friend who was studying the course and how much they enjoyed
 it. I kept in touch with them and thought the course would be a good fit for me. Unfortunately it was not. Due
 to deferring from my previous course I spent a semester working and deciding what I wanted to do with my studies.
 I landed on taking an Undergraduate Certificate in Information Technology to see if I would want to pursue the 
 corresponding Bachelor degree. I decided to go back to RMIT since it would have been less of a hassle to enrol and 
 I already somewhat knew my way around campus (Although classes are still yet to be held on campus as of yet regardless).

   	 During my studies in the Undergraduate course I expect to learn the basics of programming, database management 
	 and more knowledge of the functioning of computers. I also expect to learn more collaborative skills, especially
	 more digitally focused ones due to the COVID pandemic. I also expect to gain knowledge in more technical IT terms 
	 that will be used commonly in the industry.
