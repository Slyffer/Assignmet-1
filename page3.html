My ideal job is a lead cloud architect. This job entails many different small jobs which will help me lead a team
 to design the (hopefully) perfect cloud computing infrastructure for the company. This job is appealing to me since
 it isn't as repetitive as others and new obstacles will always be present due to the ever changing needs of the
 employer as well as the satisfaction of completing important jobs which could prevent the company from ‘grinding
 to a halt’. The job will consist of meetings with different departments and to gain insight of their needs and
 wants for their current or upcoming projects. Working back from there we would have to consult with my team to 
 discuss the best changes to allow our cloud network to run optimally and smoothly to allow upcoming projects in
 other departments to be able to commence without issue.

The skills and qualifications of this job are vast but important for the job to be properly filled. With little to no
 experience in the field and only just starting an undergraduate certificate, an information technology degree with a
 major in security and cloud computing would be the logical first step to gain access to the industry. With this degree 
 entry level jobs will be the next step to gain experience and the needed skills. Skills like teamwork and critical 
 thinking will be imperative as well as time management and clear and concise communication to effectively communicate
 needs. Amongst all these a course in project management or in resource management to help with delegation of tasks and
 resource managing the team since being the lead architect will require a lot of teamwork and leadership. Once all 
 these skills, qualifications and experience are cultivated then the job should definitely be achievable.
